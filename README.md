# Minimal RAG System â€“ Take-Home Technical Interview

This repository contains a fully functional and well-documented implementation of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system. Designed to run locally on a CPU, this project showcases how to integrate a knowledge base, semantic search, and a lightweight generative model to answer user queries grounded in retrieved content.

## Solution Highlights
- **Local, low-cost deployment** with CPU-friendly models
- **Modular architecture**: Easily replace or improve components
- **Clear semantic search** using embeddings and vector similarity
- **Custom or tool-based retrieval system**
- **End-to-end notebook demo** for interactive exploration
- **Production-ready structure** with scaling ideas outlined

## Deliverables
- Jupyter notebook demo
- Architecture slide deck
- Design rationale, implementation steps, and challenges
